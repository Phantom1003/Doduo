# Notes for agents working on Hoopa

Hoopa is a macOS menu bar app (`Sources/Hoopa`, SwiftPM, SwiftUI + AppKit):
a floating to-do panel where each to-do can be bound to a window, a browser
tab, an element inside an app or a document, and jumped back to with one
click. The user manual is `docs/manual.md`; read its *Principles* and
*Jumping back* sections before touching anything under `Context/`,
`Anchors/` or `AX/`.

There is no test target. Changes are checked by building the bundle and
driving the app by hand.

## Build

```bash
swift build             # compile check only: no bundle, icons or translations
./build.sh              # release build wrapped and signed as build/Hoopa.app
```

* `build.sh` needs Xcode (the SwiftUI macro plugin ships only with Xcode) and
  sets `DEVELOPER_DIR` to `/Applications/Xcode.app` when it is unset.
* It signs with the first *Apple Development* identity in the keychain, or
  the one in `SIGN_IDENTITY`, and **stops with an error rather than falling
  back to ad hoc**: macOS ties the Accessibility grant to the signature, and
  an ad hoc one changes with every build. Signing needs the keychain's
  private key, which the app's shell sandbox cannot reach, so run the script
  from Terminal. `SIGN_IDENTITY=-` signs ad hoc on purpose (what CI does).
* Relaunching the app after a build takes the user's running instance down.
  Ask before doing it while the user is working.
* A release is a `vX.Y` tag. Bump `CFBundleShortVersionString` in
  `Resources/Info.plist` to `X.Y` first: CI refuses a tag that does not match
  it, and the updater in running copies only installs a bundle whose version
  equals the tag.

## CI (`.github/workflows/build.yml`)

* Runs on every push to `main`, every PR, every `v*` tag and manual dispatch.
* Matrix: `macos-26` (GA, blocking) and `xcode-27` (preview,
  `continue-on-error`). Both run `SIGN_IDENTITY=- ./build.sh`.
* "Verify bundle" checks structure only: `codesign --verify --strict`,
  `plutil -lint`, the icns and menubar PNGs. No functional test runs on CI.
  On a `v*` tag it also checks that the plist version equals the tag.
* A `v*` tag publishes a GitHub Release with the `macos-26` zip
  (`Hoopa-vX.Y.zip`), ad hoc signed, not notarised. That zip is what
  `Updater.swift` downloads.

## How binding and jumping must work

* Order of preference: an interface the system or the app documents
  (AppleScript dictionary, `AXDocument`, official deep-link formats such as
  Slack's or Obsidian's), then the Accessibility tree, then the window.
* Never: OCR or screen recording, in-app search (⌘K / ⌘F plus typing),
  moving the cursor or posting HID-level events, synthetic keyboard input
  into an unconfirmed focus, or internal routes and IDs dug out of an app's
  bundle (they change between versions).
* Trigger with AX actions (`AXPress`, `AXSelected`, `AXScrollToVisible`), then
  `CGEvent.postToPid`; verify after every step; stop as soon as the target
  is reached.
* `AXEnhancedUserInterface` changes how Chromium and VS Code behave. Only set
  it inside `AX.withEnhancedUI` for the one read that needs it, never leave
  it on.
* Before supporting a new app, dump its tree: `open build/Hoopa.app --args
  --dump-ax <bundleID>` writes `axdump.txt` next to the log.

## UI conventions

* User-facing strings are English in the code and are the keys of
  `Resources/zh-Hans.lproj/Localizable.strings`. Every new string needs its
  Simplified Chinese line there; plurals go through
  `en.lproj/Localizable.stringsdict`.
* No fixed widths tuned for one language. Check layouts in both English and
  Chinese (`-AppleLanguages '(zh-Hans)'`); use `ViewThatFits` and
  `layoutPriority` where the languages differ in length.
* The collapse/expand toggle is the ear at the left edge and sits at the same
  spot in both states, so that nothing else ever lands under a just-clicked
  toggle.
* The collapsed list stays narrow (one row per to-do, 220 pt wide). Prefer
  stable, one-click layouts over hover-driven morphs.
* Liquid Glass (`.glassEffect`, `.buttonStyle(.glass)`) is used behind
  `#available(macOS 26.0, *)` with material fallbacks in `UI/Style.swift`;
  keep both paths working.

## Data and diagnostics

* To-dos: `~/Library/Application Support/Hoopa/todos.json`, a `TodoDocument`
  (`todos`, `deleted` tombstones, `orderedAt`; the bare array of older
  versions still loads). The decoder drops a binding or time it cannot read
  instead of failing the file; keep that when changing the model, and do not
  add migrations beyond that.
* Sync (`Store/SyncFolder.swift`, `TodoStore.merge`): with `syncFolder` set,
  the same document is mirrored to `<folder>/todos.json` and every outside
  change merged back per part of a to-do (`TodoItem.merged`: title, notes,
  done, binding, due each from the copy that stamped it last in `changed`;
  tombstones beat older `updatedAt`; order from the copy reordered last).
  Every edit must go through `mutate`, which stamps the parts that differ;
  a new part needs a stamp in `FieldStamps`, `stamp` and `merged`. A folder
  copy that cannot be
  decoded is never overwritten. Test with two `TodoStore`s on temp data
  directories against one folder; no app relaunch needed.
* Log: `~/Library/Application Support/Hoopa/hoopa.log` (a pick logs the
  probed interfaces and the anchors kept; a jump logs which anchor won and
  how it was confirmed). Code comments, log lines and UI strings are English.
* Preferences live under the bundle ID `local.phantom.hoopa` (`autoUpdate`
  is the daily release check, on unless set).

## Testing the updater

`App/Updater.swift` reads `HOOPA_UPDATE_API` (a GitHub "latest release" JSON:
`tag_name`, `html_url`, `assets[].name` and `browser_download_url`) and
installs the first `.zip` asset. To try it without a release: copy
`build/Hoopa.app`, bump `CFBundleShortVersionString` in the copy, sign it
(the Apple Development identity, so the Accessibility grant survives),
`ditto -c -k --keepParent` it into a directory served by
`python3 -m http.server`, and write a `latest.json` next to it whose asset
URL points at that zip. Start the copy under test with
`open --env HOOPA_UPDATE_API=http://127.0.0.1:PORT/latest.json <app>`. The
log shows `Update: new version X available` a few seconds in; *Update to X and Relaunch*
(under ⬇, in the ⋯ menu or in the menu bar menu) replaces that copy's bundle
and the relaunched process logs `Version X`. `Relaunch` carries every `HOOPA_*`
variable over, so the relaunched copy keeps reading the test endpoint. There
is no data-directory hook: a test copy shares `todos.json` and the
preferences with the real app, so quit the real one first.

## Conventions

* Commit messages: `[feature] description` or `[fix] description`, English.
  Do not commit or push unless asked.
* No personal data (real page titles, account names, Team IDs) in the
  repository, including in screenshots and log excerpts.
